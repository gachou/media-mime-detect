This package uses {{npm stream-mmmagic}} to sniff for magic-bytes on a stream without interupting the
stream. In fact, this package uses `stream-mmmagic` directly with a single change:

It ships with a custom `magic`-file that contains patterns for mime-types that are not detected
by the current default `magic`-file.

## Additional file-types

* `video/m2pt`: MPEG2-Transport-Stream (used by cameras that record AVHCD-videos)
